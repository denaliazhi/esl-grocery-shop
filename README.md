-  **Simplified, interactive store interface**
    -  Learn grammar and vocabulary in visual context
- **Responsive narration bar**

### 👩🏻‍💻 Technical details
This app was my submission for the [Shopping Cart_Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) in TOP's[^2] Fullstack Javascript path

#### Premise
Create a mock shopping cart in React with three routes: a home page, a shop page, and a cart page.
I built off of this basic premise to create an educational ESL app to help learners navigate the grocery shopping experience.

|Language or Library | Concepts |
|---------| ---------|
| `React` | Rendering and navigation with router<br>Managing state and side effect with hooks<br>Mocking and parameterized tests |

#### 🔨 Fixes and Enhancements
If I were to continue this project, I'd want to work on the following:
- Adding more grocery sections and types of products to increase the relevance of the content
- Adding text-to-speech API so that users can learn to pronounce the narrated sentences
- Adding a built-in translation feature
- Considering a more efficient way to store and update items in the cart
- Refactoring components according to SOLID
- Improving the organization and implementation of tests
